# Allergy Child
### Allergy Child? Not you again!

Allergy Child is back at it again. She is bored at home and wants to go over to her friend Lauren's house. The only problem is...she is allergic to everything! Okay, not everything, but a lot of things! The goal here is to safely get Ellie (Allergy Child) to her friend's house. Some of her mortal enemies include: CATS, CATS, and more CATS! Also, Amoxicillin, dogs, and nuts, but those things aren't super important today, as this neighborhood is specifically infested with cats. Try to avoid her enemies (cats) while directing her to her friend's house. If you run into an enemy along the way, you will lose some of your health (an inhaler). Try to get Ellie to her friend's house alive, that way they are no longer bored!!

### MVP
- Create a game screen resembling a neighborhood
- Render game screen with player's health status
- Render a player that can move freely using WASD keys
- Render Ellie's home which acts as a starting point
- Render the friend's house which, once arrived at, signifies that the player has won the game
- Render different obstacles that move around the canvas, when player collides with them, a certain amount of health is lost



### Stretch Goals
- Possibly have a safe house where you can hide from incoming obstacles
- Create a health benefit (nebulizer, I know, hardcore) that gives extra health back to the player (more so than just an inhaler)
- Create another level?
